* mean

##### mean()
##### trim - drops values - 0.3, drops 3 values from each end
##### <data>.mean <- mean(<variable>, trim = 0.3)

# Misc

## Random Plots

Testing plots

```{r data5, echo=FALSE}
plot(data5$pre_trial_cpss)
#plot(data5$post_trial_cpss) # clean data
plot(data5$pre_trial_or)
plot(data5$post_trial_or)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
