```{r Load & View, echo=TRUE}

library(readr)
data5 <-read_csv("daie_ca3_data_5.csv")
View(data5)
#head(data5, 10)
```



```{r}

## Random Plots

Testing plots

```{r data5, echo=FALSE}
plot(data5$pre_trial_cpss)
#plot(data5$post_trial_cpss) # clean data
plot(data5$pre_trial_or)
plot(data5$post_trial_or)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
